      <p>Hey! I'm Zach Barnard — a freelance web and graphic designer currently based in Chattanooga, TN. 
        I got my start making event fliers and shirt designs for myself and friends in the diy music scene. 
        Along the way, I discovered a real passion for design and the creative problem-solving that comes with coding. 
        Now, I help small businesses and individuals bring their ideas to life through thoughtful design and functional, 
        clean web experiences!If you're looking for a designer who can bring some personality and purpose to your 
        project, <a href=contact.html>let's chat</a> — I'd love to hear what you're working on!</p>
